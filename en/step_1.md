We have two PDFs that cover the 3 projects in our [Python traffic lights path](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/pathways/python-traffic-lights){:target="_blank"}. One shows how to connect using LEDs and the other using a pi-stop. Each PDF covers different elements of our projects like adding a button, buzzer and GUI.

Our PDF versions are: 
+ [Interactive traffic lights with Python and LEDS](https://github.com/raspberrypilearning/jam-worksheets/raw/master/pdf/Traffic-Lights-Python.pdf). 
+ [Traffic lights with controller GUI using a pi-stop](https://github.com/raspberrypilearning/jam-worksheets/raw/master/pdf/Interactive-Traffic-Lights-Python.pdf).

Please observe any notes on this page before printing.
